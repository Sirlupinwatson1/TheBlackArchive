# BlackArchive-Anyalsis
THe internet is filled with people trying to pawn you. Much of the internet houses an insane amount of malware. This repository contains many samples I have reversed. So enjoy. 

## Disclaimer
This is decrypted malware, none the less malware. I reccomend that unless you know a fair bit about malware to not play with fire. I the published hold no responsibility for the things I publish. This is all for educational purposes and is meant to disclouse information about the modern malware samples of our time.

## Note
All the actual exe's are included and are zipped with a password. The pass to them is BlackArchive.
